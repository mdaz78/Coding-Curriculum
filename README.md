## <a id="who_is_this_for"></a>Who is this for?

Are you a self taught developer, who can get the application to work, but gets scared of the _Big O_ notations. A programmer who wants to develop his over all coding skills and grow as a programmer. Than this Curriculum is for you.

## <a id="why_am_i_using_it"></a>Why am I using it?

I am using this curriculum to turn me into a better programmer than I am today, and help me grow my skills. You can check my daily updates and progress in [here](https://github.com/mdaz78/Coding-Curriculum/blob/master/UPDATES.md).
